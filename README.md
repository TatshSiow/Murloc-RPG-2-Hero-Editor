A save file editor for the classic SWF Flash RPG **Murloc 2: Episode 1**.

Inspired by tools like the Diablo II Hero Editor




# ❓ What is it for ?

This project allows you to directly modifying the hash-encrypted game’s save file.  
Since **Murloc 2** stores player data in local save files with a checksum/hash to prevent tampering.  
This tool can edit game saves and regenerate the correct hash automatically, so the game will accept your edited save.

## ✨ Features

- 📂 **Load & Edit Save Files** – Open your `Murloc2.sav` file and view character stats, quests, and inventory.  
- ⚔️ **Modify Hero Attributes** – Change level, gold, and more.  
- 🧩 **Equipment & Inventory Editing** – Add/remove items or adjust quantities.  
- 🔒 **Checksum/Hash Regeneration** – Regenerate corrected hash after edits so the game won’t reject your save.  
- 🕹️ **Classic Flash Game Compatibility** – Works with the local save format from the original `.swf` release.  
- 📖 **Item Codex/Database** – Search or filter to quickly find items.  
- 🖥️ **GUI-Based Editor** – Simple interface for browsing and modifying data.
